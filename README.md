# Page Visits Funnel Project

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the funnel of page visits for an e-commerce website, tracking the journey of users from visiting the site to making a purchase.

## Data Loading
Data was loaded from separate CSV files containing information about visits, cart additions, checkouts, and purchases.

## Data Inspection
The first few rows of each dataset were examined to understand the structure and contents of the data.

## Data Preparation
Columns containing unnecessary numbering were removed from each dataset to clean the data and make it ready for analysis.

## Funnel Analysis
The funnel analysis began with determining the number of visits that did not result in a cart addition. This step provided insight into user engagement and interest in products.

## More Funnel Analysis
Further analysis involved examining the progression of users from adding items to the cart to completing the checkout process. This allowed us to identify any drop-offs in the funnel.

## Final Funnel Analysis
The final stage of the analysis focused on the entire funnel, from visits to purchases. This comprehensive view provided valuable insights into user behavior and conversion rates.

## Additional Analysis
Additional analysis included calculating the time taken from the initial visit to making a purchase. Understanding the average time to purchase can help optimize marketing and sales strategies.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the funnel analysis provided valuable insights into user behavior on the e-commerce website. By understanding the journey users take on the site, businesses can make informed decisions to improve conversions and enhance the overall user experience.
